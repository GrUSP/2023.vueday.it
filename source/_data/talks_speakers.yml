You can stop by a couple times, just to dip your toes, using the beautiful and flexible UI library based on Material Design, via CDN or Vue CLI plugin. But we are sure we'll see you around again soon, once you find out you only need one command of the Quasar CLI to setup PWA support, SSR mode, Cordova/Capacitor integration, Electron integration and BEX (Browser EXtensions) development kit. Are you already thinking about settling here? Then you'll need a bit more stability! Here, take the constantly improving first party TypeScript support, plus Jest, Vitest and Cypress integrations. I know, it's a lot to digest in just a couple sentences... Ok then, let me be your guide today, I'll show you around. Ready to go? Jump in my spaceship and let's get going!"

        talk_description: "These days web performance is one of the most important things everyone wants to optimize on their apps, and it's clear to everyone how dramatic the impact of a poorly optimized website is on business.

If you’re one of those people thinking that good performance equals a good Lighthouse score, you’ve also fallen into this trap and this talk is for you. You will learn when the Google Lighthouse audit results can trick you and how to make good decisions based on its output."
